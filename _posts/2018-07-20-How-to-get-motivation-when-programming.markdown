## Genesis of the problem  
I got the problem from a short discussion with a senior schoolmate, KW, an excellent software engineer âœ¨. We discussed about working remotely and he issued this good question about how to motivate onself while working alone. I thought about the situations where I did my homework with many classmates in the same classroom when I was in middle school and those where I did homework at home and thought it is a very meaningful question, indeed.

## Answer from the discussion on quara
I find some discussions just like [working remotely](https://www.quora.com/How-does-remote-working-work) and I think the situation the first user talked about where members worked well can be contributed to their good workflow and some handy tools. I have also read about some freelance software developers' talking about their careers and daily lives, and I tend to believe that most of them did their work well because they really loved to work and took the work seriously, they did not tend to let themselves feel very relaxed when working, most developers tended to make their workspace very clean with just some essential tools like personal computer, notebook, keyboards, etc. They kept themselves dedicated just as they were in an office of a company's building.
And back to the problem indicated in the title, I saw another discussion:[discussion from quara What-can-I-do-to-motivate-myself-for-programming-regularly-for-4-6-hour](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-to-motivate-myself-for-programming-regularly-for-4-6-hours). The main points extracted from the first two answers can be listed as below:
1. Interest matters a lot but now I do not think every one can do some awesome work like those with great talents, e.g. Elon Musk, [Ryan Dahl](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-Ryan-Dahl-He-started-Node-js-an-open-source-Web-server-with-a-lot-of-buzz-yet-I-cant-find-any-background-on-this-individual-that-has-created-this-incredible-software).
2. detailed and clear roadmap like a todo list is very important.

## Answer from my experience
From my experience, I agree with the above two points a lot and another point I want to add is, some proper pressure,e.g. a deadline, some benefits which you will lose if you do not work fast.   
But I do not think pressure is good for some awesome ideas to come to your mind, they usually come when you get relaxed after some work which got your some nervous (I have always come up with some good solutions just atfer I hand in my papers in exams >\_< )  
To talk some more details about the first two points, I think they are more important than pressure in helping us learn more things.  
The first one is very tempting but thanks to the kind suggestion from my schoolmate, KW, I gradually found that it is not so easy to do every thing that interest me well, and concentrating on fewer things may let me become proficient in some skills more easily. But as a stubborn person, I really think something interest me may take me away from what I have been working on for many year in the future ðŸ˜¢ .  
And I think the second one is almost the key point to keep a person working efficiently. I often found something had taken me more time than needed just because I did not get a detailed and clear roadmaps at first and sometimes it may be due to the loss of courage to think about the difficult parts carefully and the problem is not interested to me at all, as a result, I spent a lot of time just wandering in the reading materials and hoping some key points I encountered may take me out. But in fact, it just took more time.  
The correct way to get hard things done may be just leaving it aside and doing the most urgent jobs first. When it come to the time near deadline, with the pressure and all the knowledge already known to oneself, the work can be done quickly.  
At last, I think using some persons you admire a lot to encourage yourself is good idea, I used to use Hua Luogeng as my idol to encourage myself to be diligent. And now I use a lot of great masters in computer science and an excellent schoolmate I met as my idols. Luxun's method of using his teacher's photo to encourage himself seems to work for me as well. Just look at these photos and you will think of their great achievements. Just some names in words may also help. Use something to remind you what the excellent predecessors have achieved and make some clear and achievable goals for yourself.
