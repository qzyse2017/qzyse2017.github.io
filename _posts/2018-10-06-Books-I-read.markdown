Record books I have read about computer science here, and some other about mathematics. Will updated regularly.

## Got the idea
As a person who often avoids to talk to others, I have been loving reading since the day I can recoginize words. First some story books and then some encyclopaedias about various fun things, books always make me happy.

And I have always been confident that I have a gift for choosing good books, most of the books I have read is very worth reading, though some of them are not valued a lot by others, say, Andersen's Fairy Tales, many of my classmates and friends read it but only those learning literature admitted it is great. 

Asked by my previous classmates who want to pursue a master degree in computer science but had not learned a lot about programming before, what books she should read first, I began to recall which books I have read in the past gave me great enhancement in better mastering programming, and I found it worth recording somewhere, the books I have read. After all, most of these books are worth reading many times for me in the future‚ù§.

Will record mostly books about computer science here for this blog is hosted on GitHub and it is a site for developers‚ù§, if you are interested in other books I have read, you may email me: zyck2018@gmail.com, and we could have some more communication.

## books on computer science

### Real World Haskell
Reading it recently, it has [free online version](book.realworldhaskell.org/), you may also buy a copy from links on that page.

It is written and maintained mainly buy three authors from Haskell community. Haskell community is one of the best community I have ever seen, Haskell tools' release and its specification is very stable and there are many outstanding developers contributing high-quality code in various fun projects continuously.

This book is very friendly to those new to Haskell and describes a lot of key points both in Haskell and functional programming.                                                                                                                                  
### Clean architecture: a craftsman's guide to software structure and design
Strongly recommend! Reading it recently, the author is a very old and experienced programmer and engineer, and started his carerr in developing software in 1964, he thought what he wrote in this book is useful experiences for all software engineers despite their domains and technoogies, and I think he is right, most problems talked in this book somewhat language-independent and technology-independent,(seems all books about architecture has this feature..üòÖ). And since this book is an collection of some of the authors' blog, many titles in the content, as you can see, is in question format, I think it is rather good for those like me, who need problems to lead their learning.

The author's blog: [blog.cleancoder.com](https://blog.cleancoder.com/), worth reading a lot, the author has craftsman's spirits for both his projects and his code, and he talk a lot of very tricky problems in his blog.

The book's link on [Amazon China](https://www.amazon.cn/gp/product/B07G1VZ1X6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 

### Programming Pearls(Second Edition)
Reading recently, strongly recommend! Books written by teacher of teachersüòÇ. The author is from Bell Labs and share some real problems he and his collegues came across in their daily work, and he talked the procedure they tackled them and eventually gave a lot of awesome solutions! 

Not a book just needed by those who want to compete in algorithm contests but a valuable book for almost all programmers and engineers to read.

This book has following edition and they seem also worth reading.

### ÁôΩÂ∏ΩÂ≠êËÆ≤webÂÆâÂÖ®
Its links from [amazon](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B00Y1UYRJK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1538808484&sr=1-1).

Its Chinese name: ÁôΩÂ∏ΩÂ≠êËÆ≤webÂÆâÂÖ®Ôºå means ``white hat talking web security``, but I list here for it is so great a book, the author talks the security from a system view, and I think it is a good book for newbies interested in security, most of the techniques talked in this book may be got somewhere else, I think what makes it unique is that the author adds some real examples from his work and his analysis.

Security can be rather diverse a subject and I think knowing common techniques may not be so important as knowing how to think the possible problems there and you may learn a little from this book. 

Another similar book I read is **The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security**, from Kevin D. Mitnick (similer to the name of my friend, KW, I just guessed whether he also got his name from this great hacker the first time I knew he is interested in securityüòÖ)and it just talked much less useful techniques than this book, you may read it as if you were reading some stories(however they are all real... Orz)

### The C programming language
Used to complete reading it, very classic, and because I have not written C code for a long time, could not recall those details in this book... Can be a good and light reference for you if you are going to learn C.

### The practise of programming
A book written by one of my idols Rob Pike, read it at the end of the autumn semester, I just saw it the library and did not completed reading it, selected 11 courses in that semester... really busy...

Just reading its content now makes me feel I need to read completely, some of the topics talked in this book I have also read in Golang's community blogs, they are kernel techniques that every good programmers(engineers) should master.

The first few chapters I read two years before really impressed me a lot at that time, it let me start thinking how I can be a qualified programmer(engineer) in the future since I decided to devote my life to developing.

### Hacker's delight
Read it a little in 2016 autumn, not going to complete reading it, not misled by its title, it is not a book on security but a book on bits operation to solve various interesting problems in computer science, I think it is more analogous to those about algorithms.

Still worth reading if you are hardware engineer or you are interested in C and like to use bits operation.

### Artificial Intelligence A Mooern Approach Third Edition
Not read it, but it is recommended by my teacher(who has devoted many years in artificial intelligence and I think at least his opinions are correct than most persons who claimed they are doing artificial intelligence related researches) and one of its author is my idol, Peter Norvig, I have read his blogs, really heuristic. 

This book is published a little earlier than the recent fashion of artificial intelligence and most theories discussed in this book seem to be those used last century, however,  believe, if you are going to devote yourself to AI, it is worth reading for you!

I am not going to read it so I listed it here `:)`

### Database System Concepts(6th.Edition)
Recommended by my teacher WW, a really elderly teacher üòÖ, attending his class can really unforgettable memories for most of students graduated from our institute, I think.

Very classic, mainly about relational database, some basic theories, how do you use a mature database software to serve your application, some internal mechanisms in database implementation, what your can do to optimize your data storage from a programmer's perspective, and some other more advanced topic like distributed database and concurrent control... Really heavy, both in weight and its content... worth reading and reviewing.

A little shame that I read it only to pass the exam...

### Just for Fun:the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary
From Linus Torvalds, he talked his early life with Linux. A little surprised that there is acutually someone who has similar habits like me... like wearing sandals and socks together in summer(well, this could be it is both a little cool in northern areas...) and staying alone in dark placesüôÑ... 

Back to the topic, the most valuable in this book could be that you can know a lot about the development of Linux and many thoughts of Linus himself in maintaining this porject, will make you think a lot ang think deeply about software and business...and maybe your life. And I have to admit, Linus is really a fun person...üòÇ

### Operating Systems:internals and Design Principles,eighth Edition
My teacher use it as textbook so I read it. Will give you a overall perspective about main problems(and corresponding models) in operating system and give common solution to you, eighth eidtion added some new descriptions for modern technologies and provides their comparisons in different aspects.

Do not read it very carefully for I selected many courses that semester and had to do various homework every day...

I will read it again in the future, I think.

### Pattern Classification
Textbook for my course: `Pattern recognition`. Very classic, talks about various common methods in building data analysis models... Did not read it carefully myself... And not going to read it in the future... Really a pity that I bought this heavy book just to pass the exams and get some credits...

### Artificial Intelligence a Guide to Intelligent Systems, Third Edition
Classic textbook for AI, provide you an overall perspective of AI, very light but describes theories clear. Worth reading for both those just want to learn a little about AI and those want to devote themselves into AI researches.

### Computer Networks: A Systems Approach, Fifth Edition
A lot of analysis from user's perspective and tell you many consideration by network builders step by step, worth reading for those not only want to learn some basic knowledge on computer science but also desire to implement network infrastructures themselves.

Not so heavy but very equivalent to its price~ Only read a few chapters myself, going to complete reading it in the future.

### Computer Architecture:A Quantitative Approach, Fifth Edition
Very classic!!! Worth reading for evey programmer in my opinion and for those more professional, I believe you will definitely it is a necesity for you to read!

No words can express my suprise on reading this book!

### Clean Code A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
Just read the first few chapters of this book myself, üò≠ Too much homework for me at that time... I bought it as a birthday present for myself in 2016, but just not enough time for me at that time to complete reading... And I started reading some other books on the coming long holidays... 

A very good book, especially for those writing Java, its author is the same as `Clean architecture`, compared with the book `Clean architecture` mentioned above, this book really focuses more on code level, you may have a glance at its contents and I am very sure you can know that it talks about many very tricky and debated problems that most Java programmers will encounter. 

Will complete reading it in the near future!

### Design Patterns: Elements of reusable object-oriented software
Strongly recommend! You may just follow the examples in the book and I bet you will get much deeper understanding of OOP. If you are facing some design problems in your real work, this book may also provide you some possible solutions.

For those just want to read this book without questions to ask, I recommend you read it from the end. Read the last few articles the authors wrote to explain the start of the book, and then, start reading it from begin to end.

You may also follow one of the authors, Erich Gamma on [GitHub](https://github.com/egamma) who contributed most code of vscode project and I strongly recommend you also follow another great master, [Anders Hejsberg](https://github.com/ahejlsberg), you may use his great creation, typescript(and C sharp), and refer to the code of [VScode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), and have some deeper understanding of the theories talked in the book, however, I have not tried this method myself, `:)`, hoping I can try it next year...

Erich Gamma will appear in the issue area and pull request area of vscode, and you may try to participate in the project, then you may get the chance to communicate with him, seems a little hard, or you can just search his ID use `involves:egamma` and you may see his previous discussion, sort the issues by most comments and you may see some high-quality discussion.

### C++ Primer: Fifth Edition
A book recommend by my OOP teacher He, I have to admit ashamedly that I skipped some classes to write homework... I selected 13 courses in that semester and had only 1 class time without lessons on average on every weekday... 

And I also did not read this book carefully, I read it on a politics course and just felt all were in a mess... My teacher was talking Hayek and Keynes in the front of the class and I wanted to make it clear the various declarations of const type and pointer type... `:)`, it was a long time after reading this book that I started to recognize that there is no need to memorize all the rules talked in the book, you can just use it as a good reference...

Sad story... Recommend this book to those new to C++ as a reference of syntaxes.

### ÈÄÜÂêëÂ∑•Á®ãÊ†∏ÂøÉÂéüÁêÜ
Its Chinse title means `reverse engineering: internal principle`, the author is from south korea, I read its translation in Chinese. I thought it was a great book and listed here, very heavy book, teach you how to do reverse work from beginner level to a little more experienced level. It talked about many techniques you may need while do reverse work under windows, some of its examples in the book may not work now, `:)`. 
Its link from [Amazon China](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B00K43MLA0/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538811052&sr=1-2&keywords=%E9%80%86%E5%90%91%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E6%9D%83%E5%A8%81%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97)

Did not complete reading it myself and since I spent money to buy it and have carried from school to home, I think I will eventually complete reading it.`:)` considering the great effort I have devoted...

###  Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition
Although it is a valuable book, I have to admit ashamedly that I just read the parts related to exams... 

Very classic and worth reading for every programmer, it is really just an introduction, so I do not think there should br any difficulty for your to complete reading... But you may need to think a lot and try to solve some problems existing in your mind while reading.

It contains most algorithms a programmer(engineer) may encounter in their daily work and there are many interesting problems discussed in this book...

Its value surpass its weight `:)`

### Modern Compiler Implementation in C
Textbook for compiling principle course, a great pity I had only read the part which would appear in exams.

Could be a little plain, for those who want eventually be an expert in this field, it is just an introduction, but the aspects discussed here is comprehensive, you will get an overall view of a modern compiler.

Also recommend `Compilers: Principle, Techniques and Tools, Second Edition`, I think it is much more detailed in some confusing problems' discussion, and is more reader-friendly.(though I did not complete reading it either)

## books on mathematics

Did not read many professional mathematics books myself, just listed here very few ones I could think of. 

###  Discrete Mathematics and Lts Applications

Recommended by my teacher. I read it for many practises in our textbook did not have solutions. Rather friendly for those new to discrete mathemactics and tells you a lot about why they extract specific concepts from real problems... A little pity that I have not read it carefully, and due to its heavy weight and so many pages I think I may not read it completely in the future either...

### All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference
Its link from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/0387402721/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1538999587&sr=1-2), seems really expensive contrast with the price I need to pay for its Chinese version...A little happy that I live in China and books here are so economical.

Recommended by my teacher Shen, he taught scientific computing course, and recommended this book while he taught us the lessons related to probability, he majored in maths and has learned maths for many years, very happy we could view those techniques he showed us in class, however, because his class was the first two ones on Thursday morning, I felt really tired to attend it...

And when recalling those days I could only remember a few concepts and some stories he told in class... sad... but still feel happy that I could learned a little about scientific computing and have ever read the textbook, at least, I learned why there needs to be researchers who devoting their time in various matrix related problems and why it is hard to write good scientific programs, I tried it myself, really hard, a lot of techniques... I did not write any pretty program on this course myself...Also, for the first time, I saw real applications of knowledge we get from linear algebra used in computer science.

Back to the topic, this book provides a very different view for you to learn statistics and probability theory, if you have ever learned probability theory,your textbook may just use some classic models to tell you how you can extract your problems and use some specific models to solve your problem, however, this book, "Talk a lot about estimating parameters for these models and it is very different from most textbooks"(my teacher said, I read a few chapters in this book, and are really surprised by the author's innovative perspective, maybe I am just not so familiar these theories...The only words I thought the first time I read it is "È´òÂ±ãÂª∫Áì¥")

### Scientific Computing - An Introductory Survey (Michael T. Heath)
Textbook for my course, scientific computing. Very classic, worth reading for those just started to learn scientific computing and also for those who are wondering why they need to learn linear algebra in university.

You may getan overall view of scientific computing from this book.

### Â•ΩÁé©ÁöÑÊï∞Â≠¶¬∑‰∏ÉÂ∑ßÊùø„ÄÅ‰πùËøûÁéØÂíåÂçéÂÆπÈÅì:‰∏≠ÂõΩÂè§ÂÖ∏Êô∫ÂäõÊ∏∏Êàè‰∏âÁªù

My father bought it when he saw this book in the bookstore, really a big surprise for me(he sent it to me later)!!! Loving all kinds of books related to maths~‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü§£ Its Chinese name, means: ```Fun mathematics-tangram, Chinese Ring Puzzle and Klotski: three great classic puzzles in China```.

The book make models for some problems you may(or just the maths lovers may) think of while playing these toys and do some rigorous analysis to get an answer(not too much, but you can learn the spirits a mathematician has if you aim to be one).

Just read it for entertainment and you may also get some deeper understanding of these toys if you are a lover of them.

Girl sat next behind to me in primary middle school, my friend, XJ, also bought this book later and we often communicate on some fun problems while reading, while, the problems were mainly from another book from the same series, Êï∞Â≠¶ËÅäÊñã(it means Ghost stories of Maths). It may seem more useful for whom want to use mathsmatics to solve daily problems, knowledge used here just easy, i believe if you are a programmer, you will not feel hard to read it.

The last article in this book impressed me a lot and I can still remember the author's teacing for those aim at maths, "You have to be detatched to common benefits appearing in your work and life, to gain some achievemants, you should not do it with your desire of money and fame, it will drive you away from persisting on your reasearches heart and soul and getting pure pleasure from maths itself".

I have to admit that he is right, to get the most pleasure from the problems you are tackling, you can not think of money and fame, it will just make you anxious, it is right for almost all domains, not just maths.  Without pure love for maths(you feel fun to learn, use maths and tackle puzzles), you will definitely feel regret at the end of your life!

In fact, mathematicians we can hear about are only a very small part of all who devoted their life to maths, many others are unknown to the public, they devote great efforts in this field for they love it(should they devoted equivalent efforts in some other fields, they would probably win a lot of money...)

### Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective
The author is an outstanding mathematician and I have to admit this book is just useful for those who are learning maths contest techniques and those who want to learn some common techniques in solving your daily hard maths homework problems, if you really want the force to be with you, I recommend his another book, `An Epsilon of Room, I: Real Analysis: pages from year three of a mathematical blog`

Read this book a long time ago... Can not recall many details now, the authors blog: [terryTao.wordpress.com](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)

### Recreations in the theory of numbers the queen of mathematics entertains
Read it for about ten years ago, my uncle cleared his old rooms and borrowed it to me, he also recommended some other books on philosophy and literature to me excitedly(really impressive, his excited face).

I had to say, his literature book seemed to be hard for me to understand...üòÇ

This book is a good one for those who have some basic knowledge for the theory of numbers and want to know how to solve fun and tricky porblems you may think of, may also a good entainment for those professional.

A good and impressive book for me.

### Entertaining Algebra & Entertaining Geometry
Two books I found in my father old book shelves... read it on the the october holiday of 2008 when my friend LL went to visit her grandparents... 

Talked about how to solve a lot of fun problems the author may encouter in his daily life(The author lived about a century ago... and you know...üòÇ...) May have a try to read it if you are maths lover.

## Some other books which may inspire you as a programmer but not related to your work closely

### The Zen programmer
Came across this book in school library while searching for another book, its name is just tempting, zen, seems words from Buddhism, and why it is related to programmers, and next time, when I saw [the repository](https://github.com/yesvods/nocode) once forked by my friend KW, I just really want to laugh...üòÇ, I fork the repository myself, just for fun and a faith(actually I do not believe there could be no bugs in my programsüòÇ)...

Really, programmers and engineers are facing too much pressure every day and the author's experience seems just more tough contrast with those who have majored in related subjects of computer science, the author learned it in his twenties if my memory is right... and he faced many pressures in his daily work, both in days he worked with others in enterprises and in days he started working as a freelance.

Theories talked in this book may seem a little funny to whom believe science firmly but his behaviours may be useful to your too if you are often anxious in work and can not find balance.

May have a try to read it, for those who only want to buy very useful books it may not be a good choice for you.

### Hackers and Painters Big Ideas from the Computer Age
Read it in 2016 summer holiday, really excited while reading for I found most of the author's views are so analogous to mine. And the author loves painting!!! He even majored in painting in his university(I had also dreamed of it...)

For those who only want to buy very useful books it may not be a good choice for you.

Suitable for those who are viewed as odd guys in daily life and want to get some identity from those as odd as you...(Actually, as one of the odd people, I do not think most of us will really care for attitudes from normal persons...)
 
===== 

Really happy there have been these awesome friends who learned and read books with me in the past years, have learned so much from them and these great books. Every time I think of some knowledge, the day I learned it with them come before my eyes. And really appreciated that they did not go away from me for my somewhat wierd character and move me to blacklist for my usually disturbing them with various things that I think they may interested in however they are not...üòÖüòÖüòÖ Books and these friends are truly big treasure in life‚ù§.
