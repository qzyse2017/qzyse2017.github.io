Too many TODO items have been staying on list ```~ >_< ~```, maybe just a few hundreds ```~ >_< ~```. **Make a goal here, should learn more about kubernetes and issue a pull request berfore 15th, Sep, 2018. Will not eat any food on that day if have not done it !**

Again, great thanks for my senior schoolmate KW and my father, these two kind persons had reminded me of focusing on fewer things to get them done better. All my fault, did not take their advice, after all I am not Elon Musk. ```~ >_< ~```

Use my senior schoolmate KW's saying, "Wanan go to die".ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
