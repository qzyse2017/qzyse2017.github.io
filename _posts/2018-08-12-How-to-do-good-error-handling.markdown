### Joyent and ry
Getting to know [ry](https://github/com/ry) for one of his most popular project [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) is showed in the trending page of GitHub, and I started to know that he is also the initial author of nodejs project, really inspired a lot by his frequent commits.... over 4k commits this year... And also impressed a lot by his career. 

Ry learned maths ```at the University of Rochester where he studied algebraic topology, which he once found "very abstract and beautiful" for a couple of years but later got bored of it because "it was not so applicable to real life." 
Once he realized that he did not want to be a mathematician for the rest of his life, he dropped out of the PhD program and bought a one-way ticket to South America and lived there for a year, where he found a job as a web developer. He worked on a Ruby on Rails website for a snowboard company.
```

Hope I can have the same courage as him to give up those tempting, like a doctor degree which can bring more comfortable life, but I will say no if needed, for I have to pursue something more fun to me, despite the efforts I have devoted.‚ù§

And he left Nodejs community after a few years devotion on the project, üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

One of the company which Ry once worked for, [Joyent](https://www.joyent.com/), is impressive, too.

Joyent is a sponsor of Nodejs. And its once provided service to a lot of customer solely depending on the work of decades of employers, but its profits at that time was considerable.

But the most funny thing of it I know could be **it once stopped hosting twitter**, for they thought the service of twitter was not stable and it would make other users think there could be some problems in Joyent's service...üòÇ(read it in an interview from infoQ china and do not observe some other declarations from Joyent...)
