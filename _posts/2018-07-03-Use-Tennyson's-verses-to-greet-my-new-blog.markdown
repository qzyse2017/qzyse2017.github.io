use Tennyson's verses from the poem `Ulysses` to greet my new blog and also to encourage myself to always stand up to difficulties in my career with code
```
Though much is taken, much abides; and though

We are not now that strength which in old days

Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are——

One equal temper of heroic hearts，

Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.
```
