Have been considering this problem for a few years, in fact, I have always loving thinking various ways to improve effeciency from many years ago, in almost every problem I came across in daily life, really hate waste of time(most valued) and other possible resources. 

Write this article here to record some of the rules I have learned from my experience and from those from Internet which could improve effeciency for programmer (Or I may forget some of the rules and fall into ineffeciency again).

Really impressed a lot many times by my friend KW that he could calculate how many hours was needed to finish his project... And wanted to ask him for some more details but at last, I found that was probably because he had already overcame(or he knew how to do already) all difficulties in the projects... So could he give the specific time estimation.

Define the standard of improving effeciency here first. In my opinion, it should not be limited to solely time or money. In theory, You should define the standard yourself in different environment, however, then there will be no meaning in writing this article, I am going to give a general standard here, which may be applied to most programmers, it is, finishing your work with less working days in short and less maintaining hours needed in the future.

Why this standard, I will show its value in the discussion below.

## manage your energy instead of your time

I thought time is the key of effeciency, however, easy work A and hard work B may take your 2 hours equally, but after finish the two work, you may feel very differently, and after doing the hard work, you may just feel you can not continue to do similar work and have to take a longer break, thus, you are missing some more working hours this day.

Manage the energy you spend and make your work divided to every day in a balanced way.

I am strongly suspicious that some companies require their employees to work very long hours a day, since I seldom met people who can continue to concentrate on thier work for a long time. A common working time pattern nowadays in big cities of my country is "9 am to 9 pm and continue for 6 days a week", you are spending 12 hours in your company a day and remove the hours you take lunch and dinner, you may devote actually 8 to 9 hours in your work this day and I never met a person who can provide 9 hours' high-quality work a day, in my daily life.

I spent horrible hours -- 16 hours a day in my senior high school and I never admitted it has taught me anything valuable with this disguised diligence. This experience also strengthens my belief that I should stay away from those who are doing easy work diligently(in most cases, this is because they do not master the ability to finish hard work), if some business can attract many people to come in a very short time, it is possibly because that this business do not require to overcome many difficulties and it is very profitable, and you come too, you have nothing superiority over them(the requirements are low), then to compete with these people, you can only do similar low-valued work diligently so as to please your employer and get more pay if you are paid in hours.

If you employers pay you a lot higher than your peer and you think it is equal to the energy you devote every day, just skip it. 

## do the hardest work at the start of your work

The same reason for the last one, just like running in a one-kilometer contest, you may keep runing fast for a little while at first and become slow when you are near the finish line, but if you start with a slow speed, you will also get tired and may just run slower in the second procedure.

Start your work with the hard parts and after you have done it, you will still have some energy to do the rest, or you will find that you just want to leave the hard part tomorrow because it just seems so big a task.

## move to another environment when feel tired

This is just my experience and I am not sure it will work for others.

When you feel tired and get stuck in some problems, you may move to another environment, say, go to wash your face and get a tin of Coca Cola. And do not go back to sit before your computer too quickly, shut down your computer and try to solve the problems just with your paper and pens make also work. You may feel fresh again.

## Use proper tools
Good tools will save your time and prevent you from doing redundant work many times every day.

## spend some time to gain more abilities

Use "abilities" not simply "knowledge" or "technologies" here. Technology and knowledge may change fast however, some kernel concepts, rules and abilities you used to guide your work do not, recommend a programmer, Robert C. Martin here, you may read hs books and blogs, and he talked a lot about those seldom change but will make you qualified to finish your work over years. Also, go to here some sugestions from those who are "old" in programming.

These abilities will make you finish your work with less time and less energy spending on the tricky parts, do not be afraid to solve them, if you avoid it this time, it will appear somewhere in the future again.

For example, you may try to refactor or rewrite your code and you will find it take less time for you to manage the architecture of your next project, and the project takes less time in maintaining.

Learning how to write good test code and deployment strategies also save time for you.

## Make some goals to encourage you finish the work
I finish all my homework very quickly when I was youny for girl lived next to me promised to go out to play with me after finishing homework. I even helped write her homework for her(not a good habit...though, should have avoided it...). These little goals will motivate you a lot.

Key points: you work be divided into smaller parts and some small encouragements after every small goal is reached.


## Set up deadlines
Deadlines may also motivate you and make you overcome great difficulties in a short time, energy consume may not decrease here though.

## keep workspace clean
Clean workspace and less interrupt from others can both keep you concentrated on your work more easily and thus, cost your less energy.

Clean redundant files from your computer reguarly.

## Avoid behaviours that cost your energy greatly
May vary among different people, for me, it is avoid strong emotion caused by others and avoid backhanded talk with others, these two behaviours will both cost me a lot of energy for I am not good at understanding meanings implied by others and understand what they are thinking from their expressions, I avoid to observe their expressions actually. Also, strong emotion(becoming very happy and great anger) costs my energy enormously.

To some others, they may be doing repeated but high-concentration needed work, doing exercise and driving from home for long distance...

## do the more profitable service
If you really need money, and you do not have to provide a lot every month, I recommend that you think some other ways to make money.

Programmers provide their work to their employers and the companies provide goods(service) to its customers. The value of your work does not solely depend on your ability/ the hours you spend, it may also depend on the business you are gaining profits from, you can transfer to another business(say, you may refer to Jane street Inc)

There are many other ways you can get profit, you may do some investment, I have heard some people tried using neural network to predicate the trends of stock market(focus on some specific elements) and made a lot of money from it. 

## spend more time on plan of your work before start

Good plans(may contain talking with your customer and going to experience their demands yourself) may cost your less time in change your code in the future, and make your code easy to add new functionalities in the future.

## shift between diferent tasks regularly
May keep more fresh...

## calculate which parts spend most of our time and which parts can be optimize regularly

Like profiling your program...

## Make detailed todo-list

Some other useful sugestions from discussion on quara, see the link in REF part

From Joel Johnson

>1. Find a good IDE and learn/use the shortcuts.
>2. Create a template or shortcut for each common block of code you write.
>3. Think in terms of writing automation that writes your code.
>4. Create good tests that will save debugging/testing time in the future.
>5. Sketch out the big picture (in your mind or on paper) of what you are trying to create before writing code.
>6. Don't be afraid to break the rules and write throwaway/prototype code to clarify to  yourself what you are doing.
>7. Write as little code as possible.
>8. Design primarily by iterating (not recursing) so you don't get confused/stalled as often.

From Lacy Stalmaqi
>make a list or note of your daily accomplishment and what task you have forgotten that needs to be done right away the next day. Having a list keeps your ideas from disappearing. It also helps you keep track of what you have done for the day and assess whether you have been productive or not.

>Let your fingers do some of the thinking and help unburden your brain. Muscle memory and small finger movements during activities reduces considerable mental stress and relax your mind. A good example is counting with your fingers rather than counting mentally.
>Practice developing multiple or alternative answers to a pressing question to help boost creativity and productivity. Having a plan B, C, D, and so on is always a good habit to develop, when plan A goes wrong.

From Harald Kraemer
>I'm not sure how to define efficiency. I kinda define efficiency for myself as achieving powerful results within reasonable time while maintaining a convincing heartbeat to the outside world.

>Beyond that, I think there are two hugely important things to realize: First, learn to recognize that you need to use your time more efficiently. It sounds dumb, but bear with me: Programming the end result is just the eventual conclusion of a bunch of planning, researching, talking, thinking, programming, throwing the results of previous programming away and thinking more.

>Second, you should realize that there are times and days where you won't do anything useful or where you won't create production code with acceptable quality. Might be because you have had a concert down to 3 am in the morning, might be because the weather is bad. Who cares. Don't feel bad about those times. Embrace them. Use these times to do something non-critical, silly you always wanted to try some time ago and do the productive thing with a lot more energy the next day. 

>From there, the biggest improvements for me over quite a bit of time was:

>Start documenting and reviewing requirements in a voice that is as unambiguous as necessary. I've adopted a simple "When X And Y are given Then Z happens". I write down what I understand of people requirements in that form with a high level of detail and then just give it to them. Discussion happens, adaptions happen and then I have a list of things they need. This way, I can cut a whole lot of back and forth and unnecessary work. I've found that spending a day working on such low level requirements easily saves a few days of working. 

>If applyable, demo early. Recently, one of the project managers in my company philosophized about a tool which automatically describes the changes to a product with me. It was something totally new and kinda crazy, but then again, it was nothing complicated, so I just started designing that thing and got one of my developers to work on that.
>After just about 2 - 3 days, we demo'd that project in the most minimalistic way I have ever demo'd a product. It didn't work outside of eclipse. You had to manually supply 2 or 3 different input files. You had to edit the source code to configure the darn thing. But damn, the demo was a smashing success. Opening eclipse set the entire tone for the demo as "This isn't done. You can quibble about details as much as you want, they just aren't done." 
>From that demo, we got a bunch of really good directions to work with and again, good directions and good requirements magnify any kind of actual programming efficiency you have immensely.

>Beyond that, the best low level tip I can give you from the top of my head is: Be vigilant and lazy. If you can automate something with reasonable effort, do so.  If you can use a better tool for something, use it. Ignore other people unless you are in a very special sector. Results will shut them up. 

>Or similarly, some time back I got so fed up with reading server log files while developing things. To clarify, at certain points in time, our server sends out massive JSON blobs. They scroll so fast and they are so huge, it's just downright impossible to read. And then you need to read 12000 characters of json to find that one value that's wrong. Good luck.

>Eventually I just had one of those fridays which just don't make anything useful happen and I was fed enough with this crap. So I just hammered together a tool which parses the logfiles and jams the JSON into JTrees. The friday was gone, obviously, but the development on monday was so much easier. you could just parse the communication, check problems in the communication with amazing precision and it just saved so much time. By now, that tool is a company widely used server monitoring and development logfile reader with a whole tone of features because it just saves so much time.

>So, I guess I'm rambling, but I think the tl;dr is: Learn to disregard lines of code per hour, so, local efficiency. Learn to think about mid-term efficiency, because you can raise the latter a lot even though the former might suffer at times.
