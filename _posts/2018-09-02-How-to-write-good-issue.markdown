## Create a good issue yourself

Going to write here some good conventions to make your issues more clear and more easy to get replies.

1. List some key points to make it more clear and easier for reading.
If it is a bug report, it may contain the following points:
- Some parameters of the conditions you were in, like OS version, the version of the software you are using.
- What your have done(How to reproduce)

If it is a feature request,
- the reason the issue it
- the disadvantages and advantages which may occur
- some ways you may think which could achieve it.

Give each of these items a title and make it clear showed by blanked lines inserted.

2. Follow other issue already exists and use annotation `@` to inform the users which may offer help.

3. Follow documentations or follow what others do in their issues, add some related tags to your project if possible.

## Help users of your project create issues more easily

Here some other conventions you may use in your project to guide your users.

1. set up template for your ideal issue pattern on GitHub

2. Define some tags

3. Use some conventional words and use some robots to automate some procedure(while it seems a bit hard...)
Not aware of the specific steps required myself, and I guess you may use GitHub api to achivie the goals, and you may refer to [this page](https://developer.github.com/).

And [examples](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/robots/) from kubernetes may also help.
