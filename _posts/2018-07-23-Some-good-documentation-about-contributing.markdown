Read some good documentation which described some good coding convention and workflows.  
## [k8s's contributing documentation including coding convention and github's workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide)  
Specially recommend the github's workflow parts.  
The doc for issue triage is also a good example for large projects with a lot of new issues coming every day.
