Have been curious about this problem for a long time, from the fisrt time I heard that an awesome operating system software is open source, learned about how linux project got larger from a basic and simple work of Linus Torvalds himself, learned some stories of open source leaders, learned some basic concepts about software economy.

So excited I can dive deep into this problem.

## The way RedHat get profit
The easiest way to get some answer may be to go to their website and read some about their self-introduction and product pricing.

Their website: https://www.redhat.com/en

In the "About" page, it reads: "We make open source technologies for the enterprise". RedHat get profis from other enterprise. And from their products listed below, their main profits can be from those cloud providers.

Take the four products they listed for example

### Enterprise Linux
>The consistent foundation for the enterprise hybrid cloud

>Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® powers the apps that run your business across bare-metal, virtual, containerized, and private and public clouds—all backed by our award-winning support. It's just one reason why 90% of Fortune Global 500* companies choose Red Hat. 

>Extend your Linux infrastructure with customized versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, add-on functionality, desktop options, and developer tools.New to Red Hat Enterprise Linux? Learn how it can help you modernize your IT infrastructure—and free you from the costs and burdens of legacy systems.

Below they listed main ocassions, seems really powerful. 

They get profit mainly from making specialized products with other hardware providers and software providers to make the whole systems running more efficiently, developer tools are also one of their products, which may help the developers move more fast in their daily work and thus save some cost for the enterprises in employing.

### Ansible Automation
Based on the open source project [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). This project at first is a personal project of [Michael DeHaan](https://github.com/mpdehaan) and now is sponsored by RedHat.

>Ansible is simple, agentless IT automation technology that can improve your current processes, migrate applications for better optimization, and provide a single language for DevOps practices across your organization.

Main product here seems to be "Ansible Tower" and "Ansible Engine" and it can be tried online, to buy the service you need to contact with sales directly I do not see anywhere on the website to list the price.

[This page](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) listed some of products' main features, and they mainly get profit from providing professional support from their project maintainers and provide other tool like data visualization tools and automatic schedule tools.

### OpenStack Platform




### OpenShift

And I remembered once a project from Intel named [EdgeX](https://www.edgexfoundry.org/) also has something  

edge computing is another very fascinating field which can have great power in industrial production and agriculture.

Courses and certifictes are also one of their income sources.

## Some other open sourcer
Not all open sourcers can gain much profit from what they have devoted to.

Linus is a lucky one "talk here"

Evan You(main author of vuejs)

### Those not end up their lives so happy

Not all open sourcers can make profit from their work, even the work is great.

Not going to repeat [@TODO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Katz) here, it is really sad.

When knowing these not so lucky open sourcers' stories, have more respect for those who can run a business company well with IT technolodgy. IT technology is powerful and rather young compared with other technologies used in various factories.  Those who invented these new technologies and make them popular are a group of people who are not only talented in programming but also visionary in doing great business.

[An article](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital) from Bill Gates' blog talked some of these invisible capital



## Why open source matters
### Make others cool

### Do not Repeat Yourself

### Spririts of free sharing


## Inspiration from Richard Stallman

Put [Stallman's personoal website](https://stallman.org/) here to to show my great respect of him. 




## Making your open source project great is a tough thing
In fact, not all good open source projects can be active for a long time. Most open source project we are still using today and heavily depended on are those which are successful enough, and they may still live for a long time. Those which become popular just from recent days may not live a long time as you may imagine.

It can inferred from the above that making a open source project active is really a tough thing. It needs a lot of things, a good leader, great demand and depency on the project from business usage, a bunch of good engineers who are ethusiasic in contributing to it(not essential, some of great works I have encountered are from just a few good authors)...  It can be really hard, may be harder than leading a business company.

Anyway, it can be really fun to take part in open source projects, discussing with persons who are much more talented than myself benefits me a lot and they are really diligent persons.

Author of [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) [Thomas Heller](https://github.com/thheller) contributed all his weekends on slack to answer questions from shadow-cljs users. And evey time I opened GitHub, [ry](https://github.com/ry) is pushing commits to his latest project [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). Really inspired me a lot.

Another fun thing I think open source project has is that, it give a chance to be program manager, project manager, technical support,etc. In a business company you may only do similar things every day, but when in a open source project, the discussion can take place much more free, you may issue your suggestions on how a function should perform and how to make it better and easier without various pressures.  Seeing how various rules of the project makes it running effecienctly is also very impressive.

Most importantly, to work with a group of good persons who have similar interests with me is so happy~
