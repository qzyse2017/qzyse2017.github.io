Have been curious about this problem for a long time, from the fisrt time I heard that an awesome operating system software is open source, learned about how linux project got larger from a basic and simple work of Linus Torvalds himself, learned some stories of open source leaders, learned some basic concepts about software economy.

So excited I can look into this problem.

## The way RedHat get profit
The easiest way to get some answer may be to go to their website and read some about their self-introduction and product pricing.

Their website: https://www.redhat.com/en

Web page with product prices: https://www.redhat.com/en/store 

In the "About" page, it reads: "We make open source technologies for the enterprise". RedHat get profis from other enterprise. And from their products listed below, their main profits can be from those cloud providers.

Take the four products they listed for example

### Enterprise Linux
>The consistent foundation for the enterprise hybrid cloud

>Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® powers the apps that run your business across bare-metal, virtual, containerized, and private and public clouds—all backed by our award-winning support. It's just one reason why 90% of Fortune Global 500* companies choose Red Hat. 

>Extend your Linux infrastructure with customized versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, add-on functionality, desktop options, and developer tools.New to Red Hat Enterprise Linux? Learn how it can help you modernize your IT infrastructure—and free you from the costs and burdens of legacy systems.

Below they listed main ocassions, seems really powerful. 

They get profit mainly from making specialized products with other hardware providers and software providers to make the whole systems running more efficiently, developer tools are also one of their products, which may help the developers move more fast in their daily work and thus save some cost for the enterprises in employing.

### Ansible Automation
Based on the open source project [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). This project at first is a personal project of [Michael DeHaan](https://github.com/mpdehaan) and now is sponsored by RedHat.

>Ansible is simple, agentless IT automation technology that can improve your current processes, migrate applications for better optimization, and provide a single language for DevOps practices across your organization.

Main product here seems to be "Ansible Tower" and "Ansible Engine" and it can be tried online, to buy the service you need to contact with sales directly I do not see anywhere on the website to list the price.

[This page](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible) listed some of products' main features, and they mainly get profit from providing professional support from their project maintainers and provide other tool like data visualization tools and automatic schedule tools.

### OpenStack Platform

>Red Hat® OpenStack® Platform is a cloud computing platform that virtualizes resources from industry-standard hardware, organizes those resources into clouds, and manages them so users can access what they need—when they need it.

From "Features and benefits"

>A reliable cloud foundation
>Unified management
>Partner with hundreds of certified providers
Deploy a secure private cloud
>Update a little. Update a lot.
>Ready-to-use cloud storage

They seem to provide a total solution for those who want to deploy their application in clouds in large scale and I guess the main profits can be from cooperation with some cloud providers and technical support.


### OpenShift
>Red Hat® OpenShift is a container application platform that brings Docker and Kubernetes to the enterprise. Regardless of your applications architecture, OpenShift lets you easily and quickly build, develop, and deploy in nearly any infrastructure, public or private. Whether it’s on-premise, in a public cloud, or hosted, you have an award-winning platform to get your next big idea to market ahead of your competition.
>a powerful container cluster management and orchestration system
>integrates the architecture, processes, platforms, and services needed to empower development and operations teams. It deploys reliably across environments, and it lets you meet customer demand while reducing infrastructure costs.

Did not see any price informaton on the page, seems they get profit by providing consulting service, training and certification.

### RedHat Subscription
Another special points about RedHat is that they use subscription to provide service. See https://www.redhat.com/en/about/value-of-subscription

>The software industry is filled with companies selling monolithic software, holding on to the antiquated approach of licensing and upgrade fees, in addition to a maintenance contract. The upfront costs of this approach—moving from outdated, unsupported versions—can be painful and unwieldy.
>Red Hat decided that wasn't a sustainable model more than a decade ago and our services and software have been available through a subscription model ever since.
>Now you can focus less on the pains of software and more on moving your business forward.

>With a Red Hat subscription, you get the latest technology with the assurance you need to keep your business running. You also benefit from the expertise of engineers making software the open source way.


## Some other open sourcers
RedHat is a great business company which make a lot open source project become much more successful.
Not all open sourcers can gain much profit from what they have devoted to.
Evan You(main author of vuejs) can be another good example who got profits and started a large ecosystem which provides many job chances for those who use vuejs. See https://vuejobs.com.

But there are still someone who did not gain a lot from open source project, even the work is great.

[openBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD) once faced the risk of shut down for lack of fund.
>On 14 January 2014, Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs. If sustainable funding was not found, Beck suggested the OpenBSD Project would shut down. The project soon received a US$20,000 donation from Mircea Popescu, the Romanian creator of the MPEx bitcoin stock exchange, paid in bitcoins. The project raised US$150,000 in response to the appeal, enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short-term future.

When knowing those not so lucky open sourcers' stories, have more respect for those who can run a business company well with IT technolodgy. IT technology is powerful and rather young compared with other technologies used in various factories. Those who invented these new technologies and make them popular are a group of people who are not only talented in programming but also visionary in doing great business.

[An article](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital) from Bill Gates' blog talked a lot of these intangible asset. It is worth reading for those who would like to devoted themselves in "intangible asset".
>It took time for the investment world to embrace companies built on intangible assets. In the early days of Microsoft, I felt like I was explaining something completely foreign to people. Our business plan involved a different way of looking at assets than investors were used to. They couldn’t imagine what returns we would generate over the long term.

## Why open source cool
### Make others cool
The spirit I first got from open source is "Make others cool"(even though it seemed to be first issued by Satya Nadella). Making others cool itself is a very cool idea. Open source projects make more people possible to learn from and get help from it(Especially for those who can not afford to buy expensive business software). And for developers, they just do not need to do similar works due to the authors' contribution.

### Do not Repeat Yourself
If there is no open source project, programming work will be much harder and people may spend more time working on the same things because they do not know someone has done similar work and their code is rather robust. With open source project, repetition can be reduced more or less. 

### Spirits of free sharing
Strictly speaking, there are various licenses in open source projects and not all license encourage that ```user have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.``` However, many open source projects allow their users to do so.

Use a quote from [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)

>**Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.** To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”.

It is a matter of liberty and the spirit itself is cool. In fact, not all open source projects allow their users to have the freedom talked above and not all business software allow their users to have the freedom.

## Making your open source project great is a tough thing
In fact, not all good open source projects can be active for a long time. Most open source project we are still using today and heavily depended on are those which are successful enough, and they may still live for a long time. Those which become popular just from recent days may not live a long time as you may imagine.

It can inferred from the above that making a open source project active is really a tough thing. It needs a lot of things, a good leader, great demand and depency on the project from business usage, a bunch of good engineers who are ethusiasic in contributing to it(not essential, some of great works I have encountered are from just a few good authors)...  It can be really hard, may be harder than leading a business company.

Anyway, it can be really fun to take part in open source projects, discussing with persons who are much more talented than myself benefits me a lot and they are really diligent persons.

Author of [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) [Thomas Heller](https://github.com/thheller) contributed all his weekends on slack to answer questions from shadow-cljs users. And evey time I opened GitHub, [ry](https://github.com/ry) is pushing commits to his latest project [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). My senior schoolmate KW✨ also has very high frequency of commits when coding and he can keep coding for a long time. All these awesome persons, really inspired me a lot.❤❤❤

Another fun thing I think open source project has is that, it give the participator a chance to be program manager, project manager, technical support,etc. In a business company you may only do similar things every day, but when in a open source project, the discussion can take place much more free, you may issue your suggestions on how a function should perform and how to make it better and easier without various pressures.  Seeing how various rules of the project makes it running effecienctly is also very impressive.

Most importantly, to work with a group of good persons who have similar interests with me is so happy~
