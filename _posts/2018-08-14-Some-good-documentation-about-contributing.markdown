Read some good documentation which described some good coding convention and workflows.  
- [k8s's contributing documentation including coding convention and github's workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide)  
Specially recommend the github's workflow parts.  
The doc for issue triage is also a good example for large projects with a lot of new issues coming every day.

- [vscode's contributor documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki)
Rather detailed description for contributors to rapidlly get what they want, e.g. [the code organization](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Code-Organization), [coding guidelines for code style](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Coding-Guidelines), and how to do smoke test for a new release.

- [Contributing guidelines of typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Moby's contributing guide](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [video guide about how to contribute on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
- [contributing guidelines for Go](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki)
- [Rust contributing guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
Rather detailed in describing various aspects of the project
