Found a book worth reading a lot, **Software Fondations** and most of all, such a great with a lot of thought essence is just free!!!!  Its link: https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu

Thanks a lot for the author's sharing!

Really hoping I can read it all in my life, after all, it seems such a tome!  ```T_T```

In fact, really found that, even computer science is a young domain, most of the problems I overcame every day had almost all been solved by previous persons and it is really worth reading some more valuable books written by these great persons.

There seems to be various technologies emerged every day, but in fact all the tough problems have almost been discussed by some genuises before, these new technologies emerged jus because the environment is changing and some of their flaws just become less crucial. Really no need to pursue what is fresh, what looks cool. Learning about a domain's history and finding right solutions is much more important, there buried what is really cool!

IMHO, the kernel skill for an engineer(not software only, all domains engineers here) should be the ability to extract model from problems, find appropriate solution, apply the solution with specific conditions and achieve a nice tradeoffs for the condition.

Math skill is usually a skill emphasized a lot for engineers, it may probably because you can not find the solution quickly if you have not heard some knowledge of that domain, from my personal experience, I agreed a lot that math skill is extremely important and it is worth learning a lot, but seems no need to learn it as if we were going to dive deep into it and win a Fields Medal, we just need to master some basic and common theorems and practise getting the problems in the textbook done, many good textbooks will introduces pratical problems and try to let you feel how this knowledge should be applied.

Currently not read the book **Softerware fondations** or get some successful solution from it, just got a simple glimpse of the index myself, going to read it in the future and try to get some problems in reality done by searching answers in it.

Hoping I can share more experience with taking something awesome from this book in the future.

## Some other trivias:

Here, another time, reminded me what my OOP teacher He, has taught us in class, "When we interviewed students who were going to apply for master's degrees, we asked them what is the first step you should do when writing a new softwareï¼Œthey answered what they learned from software engineering course, just like, analyse the demands, draw UML graphs, etc. But I think they should search some possible solutions done by previous persons, learned whether the solution is good enough and whether it can be improved."

I also observed similar actions from senior schoolmates KW, he is rather skilled in finding good solution and applying their work to is own. Orz. Really learned a lot from him.
